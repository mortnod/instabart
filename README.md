# Instabart

## Introduction

Instabart is a collection of nifty links that makes life as a NTNU student a tad easier. You can see it in action at [instabart.no](http://instabart.no).

## Overly verbose introduction

As a NTNU student there are lots of useful websites at your disposal. Unfortunately, finding them is nearly impossible. Even if you know what you're looking for, good luck finding it via the [university website](http://xkcd.com/773/).

Instabart solves this problem by collecting all the things you need in one place. On top of that, Instabart use NTNUs [single sign-on](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/single-sign-on) so that you get directly logged in without any fuzz.
